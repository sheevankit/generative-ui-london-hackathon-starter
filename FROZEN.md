# FROZEN.md

**Frozen on:** 2026-05-28
**Forked from:** `CopilotKit/CopilotKit@upstream/main` (commit `23af69041`), path `examples/integrations/langgraph-python`
**Verifier:** `pnpm verify-pins`

This is the canonical source of truth for what version of every load-bearing
dependency this starter runs against. CI re-runs the model-ID probe nightly so
a Google or upstream change is caught before event day.

> **Do not bump these.** AI assistants are explicitly forbidden from changing
> `@copilotkit/*` versions in `AGENTS.md`. The pre-commit hook rejects drift.

### Why this default (and why NOT 3.5 Flash)

`gemini-3.5-flash` is the **current** Google Flash model (released 2026-05-19,
beats 3.1 Pro on agentic benchmarks at Flash pricing, 1M context). It is the
model we'd ship if we could. We can't, because of a client-side compatibility
issue, not because 2.5 is preferable.

The actual reasoning, in order of importance:

1. **Multi-turn compatible with `langchain-openai 1.1.9`.** This is load-
   bearing. See "The Gemini 3.5 Flash trap" below.
2. **Agentic-tuned.** Google positions Gemini Flash as the agentic flagship.
3. **Sponsor alignment.** Google is the venue + platform sponsor.
4. **Free tier.** No credit card required.
5. **Zero code rewrite.** OpenAI-compat endpoint works with existing `ChatOpenAI`.

#### The Gemini 3.5 Flash trap

`gemini-3.5-flash` 200s on a single-turn tool-calling probe but **400s on the
follow-up turn** with:

```
Function call is missing a thought_signature in functionCall parts.
This is required for tools to work correctly … Please refer to
https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thought-signatures
```

Gemini 3.x emits "thought signatures" with every tool call and requires the
client to replay them on subsequent turns. `langchain-openai 1.1.9` does not
implement this — it strips thought metadata. `reasoning_effort: "none"` does
NOT disable the requirement. Re-confirmed by re-probing on 2026-05-28 after
the initial fork-date probe.

**Upgrade paths to 3.5 Flash (priority order):**

1. **Switch primary LLM to `langchain-google-genai` (native Gemini SDK).**
   The native SDK handles thought_signature replay correctly. ~5-line swap
   in `agent/main.py` and `agent/src/a2ui_dynamic_schema.py`. Adds a new
   dep and a different `model_kwargs` surface. This is the only available
   path *today*.
2. **Wait for `langchain-openai` (or any OpenAI-compatible client) to ship
   thought_signature passthrough.** Then we keep the OpenAI-compat code
   path. The nightly CI probe (see `.github/workflows/nightly-gemini-probe.yml`)
   catches this the day it lands.

The `gemini-2.5-flash` default is the safest choice for the 5-hour build
window — it's the latest model that "just works" with the inherited
`langchain-openai` code path. Teams that want 3.5 Flash today can apply
path (1) themselves following the same pattern.

### Models that 404'd in the probe (do not use)

- `gemini-3.0-flash`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-latest`
- `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`

### Free-tier rate-limit behavior

Measured 2026-05-28 against `gemini-2.5-flash` via the OpenAI-compat endpoint
with a single API key. Tool see `scripts/load-test-gemini.py`.

| Concurrency | Successes | Failures | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Wall (ms) | Retry-After |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 30 / 30 | 0 | 1707 | 2027 | 2104 | 2315 | none |
| 100 | 100 / 100 | 0 | 1883 | 2314 | 2817 | 2973 | none |

Single-key cliff is well above 100 concurrent agentic tool-calling requests.
At London-hackathon scale (~30 teams × per-team API keys + a small mentor
fallback pool), this is comfortable headroom. PLAN.md's three rate-limit
mitigations (per-team keys via prereq email, mentor fallback pool, `OFFLINE=1`
insurance) are sufficient; we do NOT need to ship a shared key.

> **HACKATHON.md "if you get rate-limited" runbook:** if a `429` ever appears
> in chat, fall back to `OFFLINE=1` for the demo. The envelope inspector still
> shows real A2UI surfaces from `public/offline-envelopes.json`.

## Vendoring (Workstream F)

`vendor/` will mirror `@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer` and `copilotkit` (Python) as a
fallback if upstream cuts a breaking release before event day. CI proves the
vendored mirror builds and renders the smoke envelope. Swap procedure documented
in `vendor/README.md`.

_Not yet populated — added in Workstream F._
